	<h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>
		The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) Is a proposed amendment to the constitution of the United States. The amendment would seal gender equality into law, and would put an end to the denial of rights to people of any sex or gender. The amendment states; "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex." The amendment was first proposed to congress in 1923 by the nephew of Susan B Anthony; Daniel Anthony. In the years between its first proposal and 1972 is was proposed at every meeting of congress, but it was not until the year 1970 that it began to be taken seriously in congress. By 1972 it had passed in both the house and congress, and it was subsequently sent to the states for ratification.However, despite its popularity the amendment failed to achieve the necessary quantity of ratifications from the states and failed to pass the ratification process; the amendment was only 3 states short of achieving ratification. To this day it is the most proposed amendment in congress. "About ten percent over 1,100 of all the amendments introduced in congress have been for the ERA." Despite its popularity it has yet to be passed to this day.

	<h2>The Issue:</h2>
	 <p>
     One of the issues the amendment sought to solve was the existence of so called 'protective' labor laws that prevented women from fully entering the workforce. "In the early 20th century there were many laws designed to protect women; these laws excluded women from certain professions." Even with the right to vote women were relegated to second class citizens due to their exclusion from many well-paying jobs. These laws went unquestioned for decades and it wasn't until World War Two that serious pushback against protective labor laws grew into a serious political force. The forces standing against the women's movement were largely motivated by profit and competition, and were broadly comprised of three main components; a general culture of misogyny among men at the time, the fact that working class men did not want to increase the amount of competition they faced in the labor market, and the capitalist classes desire to maintain women as a cheap source of low skill labor.
	</p>
	<h2>The Solution:</h2>
	 <p>
	   The feminist movement at the time came to the conclusion that the solution to the problem of 'protective' labor laws was the enshrinement of gender equality into law. Some elements of the feminist movement even believed that protective labor laws should be maintained, but changed to include men into the protective labor legislation as well. The ERA grew out of the experiences and beliefs of the feminist movement in the 1920s. Faced with the issues of misogyny, unequal acsess to high-paying jobs, the wage gap, and protective labor laws; issues which still plauge modern society. Even now the ratification of the ERA would greatly impact the lives of women in a positive way and provide a more equal society. Although never passed the, ERA still has proponents to this day, and its ratification is not an impossibility.
