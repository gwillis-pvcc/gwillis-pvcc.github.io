		<tr>
			<td>Machine language</td>
			<td>A programming language which a machine can directly read; binary for example.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Debugging</td>
			<td>The process of removing unwanted aspect from a program or piece of code.</td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Assembler</td>
			<td>A program that converts symbolic code into machine language.</td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Assembly language</td>
			<td>A mid-level language that is converted by an assembler. </td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Translator</td>
			<td>A program that converts one language to another language.</td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Compiler</td>
			<td>A program that converts code in a high-level language into machine language.</td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Interpreter</td>
			<td>A program that directly executes code as it is written without converting the code to machine language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cross-platform software</td>
			<td>Software designed to function in a multitude ofcomputing platforms; increasing its versatility and userbase. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Natural language</td>
			<td>A programming language that is written in spoken/written human-languages. Makes it easier for the programmer to code since the syntax is easy and natural to unserstand.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Formal language</td>
			<td>A laguage which is encoded via a formal system; does not rely on context. Formal languages rely on a syntax.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Machine independence</td>
			<td>Software that can be run on any machine.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>High-level programming language</td>
			<td>A newer gen language which makes use of intuitive syntax; often based on human languages and allows the coder to code in their native language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>object-oriented programming</td>
			<td>A model of programming that relies on data/"objects", as opposed to logic/functions.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Scripting language</td>
			<td>A language where the code is interpreted as it is run, instead of before the code is run</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Data types:
					<li>Float</li>
					<li>String</li>
					<li>Integer</li>
			</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>A variable in the form of anumber with a floating decimal point. </li>					
					<li> A variable in which everything placed inbetween a set of '' is shown.</li>
					<li>A variable in the form of a whole number.  </li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Primitive data type</td>
			<td>Data types which are predefined; not defined by the programmer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Data structure</td>
			<td>A formating process for the storage/accumulation of data.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Python collection data structures:
					<li>List</li>
					<li>Tuple</li>
					<li>Set</li>
					<li>Dictionary</li>
			</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>A list is a means to store multiple items in a single variable, and can be modified later. </li>
					<li>A tuple is a means to store multiple items in a single variable, but can not be changed later. </li>
					<li>A set is like a list or tuple, but is unordered. </li>
					<li>A dictionary is a means of storing multiple items in a variable, but the data is unordered and organized by key-value pairs. </li>
				</ul>

		<tr>
			<td>Function</td>
			<td>A chunk of code that performs a specific task.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Local variable</td>
			<td>A variable that only exists in a specific function(s) or block.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Global variable</td>
			<td>A variable that applys the all functions/blocks in the code.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Source program</td>
			<td>A high-level code written in a txt file; can't yet be read by a machine.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Object program</td>
			<td>The output of a source code when read by a compiler.</td>
